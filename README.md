# Spring_boot-JPA-Hibernate-CRUD-flyway-maven-PostgreSQ
 In this project, I try to cover Dependency Injection(DI) and Inversion of Control (IoC). Considered the concept of Bean and his life cycle. Also, I tried to develop a Spring application with Maven. tried to take a closer look at the Model-View-Controller pattern, looked at the Java Persistence API and Hibernate, implement the CRUD paradigm in my application, and explored the PostgreSQL data storage. implement Web services using the Spring REST framework. build a service that accepts HTTP GET, PUT, POST, and DELETE requests and responds with a JSON representation of a greeting. and used flyway as database version control and PostgreSQL as relational database management system.
